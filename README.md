In this Following assignment I've answered and completed the following algorithms:

1.Binary Sequences:
Write a program that prompts the user to input 3 positive integers, each consisting of 9 digits. After each number, the user presses Enter. (Invalid input will be reported to the user, and the program will wait for valid input.) 
The program will convert the entered numbers into decimal numbers and print them in ascending decimal format. Additionally, the program will provide statistics on the input:
The average number of zeros/ones in each input (i.e., summing all zeros/ones entered from all inputs and dividing by the number of inputs).
How many of the entered numbers are powers of 2.
How many of the entered numbers have digits, in their decimal representation, forming an ascending sequence.
Which number is the largest and which is the smallest.

2.Write a program that prints a pattern of asterisks to the screen in a diamond shape (Implement this using recursion.)

3.Write a program that functions similarly to the "Diamond for Beginners" program but accepts the desired height of the diamond as input from the user.
(Notify the user of invalid input.)
In the case of an even input, consider adding an extra row in the middle or adding/removing 1 from the input.

4.String Analysis:
Write a program that takes an 8-character string as input (e.g., "babcttcbab") and provides the following information:
Whether the string is a palindrome (implement using recursion).
If it is a number - whether it is divisible by 5 without a remainder.
If it is an English string - the count of lowercase letters it contains.
Note: The string must consist of English letters only (uppercase or lowercase) or numbers only. Strings such as "bb2r452b" are invalid. Note also that uppercase letters are considered different from lowercase letters.
Number Statistics:
Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer consisting of 9 digits and provides the following information:

The largest digit in the number.
The smallest digit in the number.
How many digits in the number are divisible by 4 without a remainder.
How many digits are greater than the unit digit in the number.
Note: The input "000000123" is valid. In this case, the unit digit is 3, which is also the largest. There are 6 digits in the number divisible by 4 without a remainder, and the average of the digits is 0.66.
